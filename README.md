# C Basics Workshop
Slides

### Introduction: creation and history (3mn)
- The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
- There were no "A" or "B" programming languages that directly preceded C. However, B was indeed a precursor to C. B was derived from BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language)
- C was initially created for internal use at Bell Laboratoies, C offered a good balance between high-level abstraction and low-level control
- C's combination of portability, efficiency, and support for structured programming made it revolutionary and paved the way for modern systems programming languages.

### Low level vs high level / C vs Ruby (10 mn)


- Writting our first program in C
	- the program: the main function
	- printf: “hello Wolrd” (compare to puts)
- Data types (the main ones)
	- main function int
	- printf with various examples
- variable declaration (with data type sepcification)
- scanf / printf demo (compare to gets.chomp)
- function declaration (with data type specification)
	- 
- malloc?

- pointers?

- .even? in C
